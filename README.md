# Synapse Design Language

> Synapses are the _'bridge'_ between the heart (of design) and the head (of programming).

#### Fundamentally, **this design language aims to:**

* **eradicate ambiguous designs** (i.e. prevent misinterpretation of a design)
* **improve the end product**
* **reduce the number of design drawings** per component
* make the process of **turning designs into code easier**
* **reduce technical debt**
* **reduce the back and forth** between design and development
* generally make design and development much **more efficient and fun**

#### Incorrect assumptions designers and developers have about each others jobs...

1) Pixels values **aren't always helpful** for developers.
2) Few, if any, software products aimed at improving the design development process
   actually do.
3) Flexible widths are **not** a complicated thing to communicate.
4) Some parts of design can and **should be** subjective decisions.
5) Some parts of design **should not be** subjective decisions.

#### ...and how to fix them:

1) Four super simple and flexible units
2) The pen is still mighty even now
3) You can define 99% of flexible widths with no more than 4 tangible numbers
4) Address which ones are.
5) Address which ones aren't.
